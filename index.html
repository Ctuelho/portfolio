My goals with this game were to create a sensation of solitude and slow-passing time. The player is alone in a desolate place and the only company they have is a giant slow-moving grub that will, eventually, pass, leaving the player alone again. The grub moves so slow that the player has time to cultivate plants to feed it, but also to stop it from moving while it is busy eating, delaying its departure.

By exploring dungeons and completing quests for the Mercenaries Guild the player would discover more about the world's history, become stronger, and maybe even change the destiny of the world.

Unfortunately, I did not get to play much, because I almost always got to be the game master :'(. But I really enjoyed creating the histories and worlds.</p><p>I also used to make a lot of board games to play with my friends. We really liked rolling dies to walk and discover the events on the board! I even made some card games, card by card! I remember I used to color the cards with Hydrocolor!</p><p>During college, I had the opportunity to participate in a scientific initiation where the theme was Art and Technology in <a href="http://ecoarte.info/ecoarte/" target="_blank" style="color:#d3d3d3">Ecoarte</a>. I was responsible for implementing interactive graphics applications, with Arduino and Processing, that compounded the piece of digital art. That was my first contact with computer graphics.</p><p>I also participated in a scientific initiation where we developed an experimental game to teach Physics to children. I had to implement some physics functions, such as buoyancy, and some AI, such as the flocking algorithm. That was my first contact with Unity and C#, since then we live as a happy threesome.</p><p>My goal in life is to work only with games! Programming, designing, testing, and art! I love it so much! I have a dream of one day publish the games I dream of making!</p><p>I am on the spectrum! It was a late diagnose, but I guess it explains a lot xD</p><p>I am part of the LGBT community, so I am looking for joining an inclusive company!</p><p>I vegan and love animals! Actually I have 5 and 1 dog. They are my angels and I will miss them so much when I move T_T. I hope it's possible to take them with me one day...</p><p>I enjoy a hot cup of coffee twice a day!</p><p>My favorite games are Elder Scroll Online and Dark Souls 3!</p><p>If you want to talk or play with me, reach me out on <a style="color:#d3d3d3" target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071827715/">Steam.</a></p></div></div><script>document.getElementById("hidden-lore").onclick=()=>{document.getElementById("lore-scroll").style.display="block",document.getElementById("hidden-lore").style.display="none"}</script><script>!function(e){function r(r){for(var n,l,f=r[0],i=r[1],p=r[2],c=0,s=[];c<f.length;c++)l=f[c],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,l)&&o[l]&&s.push(o[l][0]),o[l]=0;for(n in i)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(i,n)&&(e[n]=i[n]);for(a&&a(r);s.length;)s.shift()();return u.push.apply(u,p||[]),t()}function t(){for(var e,r=0;r<u.length;r++){for(var t=u[r],n=!0,f=1;f<t.length;f++){var i=t[f];0!==o[i]&&(n=!1)}n&&(u.splice(r--,1),e=l(l.s=t[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},u=[];function l(r){if(n[r])return n[r].exports;var t=n[r]={i:r,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[r].call(t.exports,t,t.exports,l),t.l=!0,t.exports}l.m=e,l.c=n,l.d=function(e,r,t){l.o(e,r)||Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t})},l.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},l.t=function(e,r){if(1&r&&(e=l(e)),8&r)return e;if(4&r&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var t=Object.create(null);if(l.r(t),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&r&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)l.d(t,n,function(r){return e[r]}.bind(null,n));return t},l.n=function(e){var r=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return l.d(r,"a",r),r},l.o=function(e,r){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,r)},l.p="/portfolio/";var f=this.webpackJsonpportfolio=this.webpackJsonpportfolio||[],i=f.push.bind(f);f.push=r,f=f.slice();for(var p=0;p<f.length;p++)r(f[p]);var a=i;t()}([])</script><script src="/portfolio/static/js/2.bad7bca6.chunk.js"></script><script src="/portfolio/static/js/main.fbb24c91.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
