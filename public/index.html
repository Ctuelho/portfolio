        <h2>Game Developer/Game Designer</h2>
        <div id="cover-letter">
          <p>
            I am a generalist game developer with more than 5 years of experience.
            Graduated as a Bachelor in Science and Technology by UFBA, I had the chance to learn Programming, Math, and Science, but I also studied Design and Arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked on PC/Mobile games, 3D tools, and Augmented Reality applications and participated in many jams along those years.
            From Gameplay, AI, and UI, to visual effects, shaders, and optimizing rendering. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about games and I love what I do, especially if it is Game Design, Gameplay or VFX. If you need an all-rounded, experienced, many-skilled, and creative game developer, here I am!

            <p class="game-description">
              My first independent mobile game, released on May 1st, 2020.
              It's a casual game and the idea is to be more of a distraction than a challenge.
              The mechanic consists of making the biggest line possible to keep the energy bar filled.           
              I was responsible for:</p>

              <li>Art - I made the sprites and visual effects</li>
              <li>Google Play - I made the integration with Google Play</li>

            <p class="game-description">
              A reinterpretation of the classic Pac-Man. I added some action and characters with specific abilities and stats.
              That was nice to create the abilities and balance their powers to fit the world of Pac-Man.
              I was responsible for:</p>
            <ul class="duties-list">
              <li>Game Design - I designed the characters, skills, mechanics, and enemies, using the classic Pacman as base</li>
              <li>Level Design - Using the classic Pacman level, I designed a more symmetric and balanced level</li>
              <li>IA - I designed (and programmed) the behavior of the characters using some basic concepts of Graphs</li>
              <li>VFX - I created particles and visual effects</li>
              <li>Programming - I programmed the thing</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10;">*I did not make the toons, I got it from some free source game site which I cannot remember now. If you are the creator, please contact me and I will give the credits!</p>

               I prototyped an action roguelite with online content for mobile platforms.
               By exploring dungeons and completing quests for the Mercenaries Guild, the player would discover more about the world's history, become stronger, and maybe even change the destiny of the world.
               Strong players can compete in the Arena or join forces to defeat world bosses.
               The player doesn't choose a class, instead, they can make their own build, use the weapon and armor they like.

              During my time in Sinergia Games, I worked on many small projects. 
              Most of the projects were cultural games to teach about African Culture or personal development.
              That was the first game studio I worked in, and I had the chance to explore all stacks of game development.
              Unfortunately, those games are not available anymore due to business reasons.

        <h2>Hidden Lore</h2>
        <p id="lore-book">
          In my childhood, I was fascinated by RPG and was always creating campaigns and characters. 
          Unfortunately, I did not get to play much, because I almost always got to be the game master :'(.
          But I really enjoyed creating the histories and worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also used to make a lot of board games to play with my friends. 
          We really liked rolling dies to walk and discover the events on the board!
          I even made some card games, card by card! I remember I used to color the cards with Hydrocolor!
        </p>
        <p>
          During college, I had the opportunity to participate in a scientific initiation where the theme was Art and Technology in <a href="http://ecoarte.info/ecoarte/" target="_blank" style="color: lightgray;">Ecoarte</a>.
          I was responsible for implementing interactive graphics applications, with Arduino and Processing, that compounded the piece of digital art. That was my first contact with computer graphics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also participated in a scientific initiation where we developed an experimental game to teach Physics to children. 
          I had to implement some physics functions, such as buoyancy, and some AI, such as the flocking algorithm.
          That was my first contact with Unity and C#, since then we live as a happy threesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal in life is to work only with games! Programming, designing, testing, and art! I love it so much! I have a dream of one day publish the games I dream of making!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am part of the LGBT community, so I am looking for joining an inclusive company!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am Vegan and love animals! Actually I have 3 cats and one dog. They are my angels and I will miss them so much when I move T_T. I hope it's possible to take them with me one day...

          I enjoy a hot cup of coffee twice a day!
